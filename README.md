## Project Tittle: i-Volunteer

## Introduction of the Proposed Mobile Application
  According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the act of volunteering is defined as helping people willingly and without pay (Cambridge Dictionary, 2021). Under the International Labour Organisation (ILO), there are two types of volunteerism, formal and informal. Formal volunteering, also known as organization-based volunteering, is the act of volunteering with a formal establishment to a well-defined social structure, position, and function. Informal volunteering, often known as direct volunteering, is the act of volunteering that occurs outside of the jurisdiction of a structured group or charitable organisation (Manual on the measurement of volunteer work STATISTICS Department of Statistics, 2011.). Dating back to the 12th century, there were more than 500 hospitals in Britain being run by volunteers. The origins of coordinated volunteering as we know it now may be traced back to major conflicts and wars, when young people, particularly women, banded together to assist injured soldiers and gather supplies. Officially structured volunteering began in the nineteenth century, peaked in the early twentieth century, and certain groups are still functioning today (todd, 2019). Volunteering in Malaysia is also popular within the youth with the growth of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in this country. Mercy Malaysia, WWF, Global Peace Mission Malaysia, Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) are some examples of these organisations. 

  Although volunteering is popular among Malaysian youths, the process of finding and registering for these programs is still inconvenient. Most of these programs are spotted through  social media and sometimes on the official websites of the NGOs (Bridge To Volunteering – An Introduction to Volunteering Webinar, 2021). This can be quite tough for first-time applicants who are new to volunteering as they might not be aware of these organisations in the first place. Meanwhile, as for registration it can be done manually or through online forms. After registering, applicants will usually wait for confirmation through email, call or text (Bridge To Volunteering – An Introduction to Volunteering Webinar, 2021). There is no central system that can spread the information of these organizations. Hence, the idea of this mobile application is to connect volunteering enthusiasts to a variety of organisations on a single platform. Through this platform they are able to access all of the programs that will commence and easily register themselves as volunteers. All they have to do is create an account, fill in some personal details and they are all set. As for the NGOs, they are also able to make an account and share about their programs by filling in the form. 

## Objective of the Proposed Mobile Application
1. Connect volunteers to non-governmental organisations
2. Ease the process of searching and registering for volunteer programs
3. Make volunteering accessible for all
4. Create a volunteering community especially among Malaysian youths

## Features and Functionalities of the Proposed Mobile Application
1. Users can create an account as an organization or a volunteer and log in to use the app
2. User can fill in their personal/organization details in the app
3. An organization can share their programs with the volunteers by filling in a form about the program and its details
4. The volunteer can see all the programs available that have been shared and published by the organizations, and see their details by clicking on the program
5. The volunteer can join any of the programs listed just by clicking the program details and clicking join

## Challenges/Diffuculties to develop the application.
>1. We had trouble with the version of react navigation because each of them have its own set of commands.
>2. Lack of source to refer to make us unable to develop some expected functions.
>3. We faced some difficulties when compiling everything into one file and navigating each interface.
